      <p>If you reject work, you are not doing it properly. If you think work is exclusive of magic, you are not being creative enough. rt you think work is exclusive of pleasure, you are old-fashioned. "Balance" only matters if you receive the creative world in a binary of black and white. INDUSTRY IS SEXY. 
        The impulse to work should be as unapologetic and immediate as the impulse to eat or to fuck. </p>

      <div class="sm-section-two-paragraph">
      There is a meme recirculating that quotes Fran Lebowitz's argument that 
no one "earns" $100 million a year they steal it. People "earn" $10 an hour, she says, or $40,000 a year. They "steal" their $100 million. We're not 
actually condemning thieves -or anyone else. It's just essential that everyone understands these nuances.

          </div>
            <div class="sm-section-three-paragraph" >
You are mistaken if you think using the word "love'' 
is enough to conjure the thing itself. Love is an inclusive form 
of energy. Do it hard, impossibly, radically, and as often as possible. 
Understand that love is not opposed to entropy, to mutiny, 
to mold, or to matter. Understand that while love is changeable, 
it is not exchangeable. To commodify it is corrupt, 
like deep-drilling for fuel when renewable energy surrounds us 
in the earth, air, and sea.
