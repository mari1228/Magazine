      <p>If you reject work, you are not doing it properly. If you think work is exclusive of magic, you are not being creative enough. rt you think work is exclusive of pleasure, you are old-fashioned. "Balance" only matters if you_J)erceive the creative world in a binary of black and white. INDUSTRY IS SEXY. 
        The impulse to work should be as unapologetic and immediate as the impulse to eat or to fuck. </p>

      There is a meme recirculating that quotes Fran Lebowitz's argument that 
no one "earns" $100 million a y_ear -they steal it. People "earn" $1 0 an hour, she says, or $40,000 a year. They "steal" their $100 million. We're not 
actually condemning thieves -or anyone else. It's just essential that everyone understands these nuances.
